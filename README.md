Here is my solution to the AWH interview exercise.

## How do I get setup?

- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/eddiesonmahusay/clockwork.git`.
- Change the variable clockworkHost in [Clockwork.Web/Scripts/clockwork.js](Clockwork.Web/Scripts/clockwork.js) to your API host address.
```
var clockworkHost = "http://localhost:19897/";
```
